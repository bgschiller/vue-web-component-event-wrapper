# vue-web-component-event-wrapper

I want to add type information for the events a component might emit without capturing them. That is, I want the component to continue to forward attached event listeners to the root element of a template.

## Interesting files:

- SomeCustomElement.ts, which defines a web component that emits some custom events.
- SomeWrapper.ts, which defines a Vue component wrapping the web component.
- App.vue, which uses the `SomeWrapper` Vue component and shows a type error in my editor (though not on build ðŸ¤”)

Everything else is generated by `npm init vite` and can be safely ignored.

## setup

1. `npm i && npm run dev`
2. Note the type error in App.vue: https://clip.brianschiller.com/pqVbFXq-2022-07-13.png (is this just because I have my editor set up wrong? There's no error when I run `npm run build`).
3. Open up the running app. Observe that `my-callback invoked` is printed to the console. Things are working, in spite of the type information.
