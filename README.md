# vue-web-component-event-wrapper

Forward typed events through a Vue wrapper of a web component

## setup

1. `npm i && npm run dev`
2. Note the type error in App.vue: https://clip.brianschiller.com/pqVbFXq-2022-07-13.png (is this just because I have my editor set up wrong? There's no error when I run `npm run build`).
3. Open up the running app. Observe that `my-callback invoked` is printed to the console. Things are working, in spite of the type information.
4.
